✅ **Enhanced Logging** - Detailed logs for Xiaozhi platform interactions and tool usage  

## 🔧 Quick Start

### Xiaozhi Integration Setup

1. **Configure Xiaozhi Connection**:
```json
{
  "xiaozhi": {
    "enabled": true,
    "webSocketUrl": "wss://api.xiaozhi.me/mcp/?token=your-jwt-token",
    "reconnect": {
      "maxAttempts": 10,
      "initialDelay": 2000,
      "maxDelay": 60000,
      "backoffMultiplier": 2
    }
  }
}
```

2. **Add to mcp_settings.json**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "amap": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@amap/amap-maps-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "AMAP_MAPS_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless"]
    },
    "fetch": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-fetch"]
    },
    "slack": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"],
      "env": {
        "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "your-bot-token",
        "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "your-team-id"
      }
    }
  },

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Traditional MCP Endpoints
```
http://localhost:3000/mcp          # Unified endpoint for all servers
http://localhost:3000/mcp/$smart   # Smart routing with vector search  
http://localhost:3000/mcp/{group}  # Group-specific endpoints
http://localhost:3000/mcp/{server} # Server-specific endpoints
```

### Xiaozhi Platform Management *(New!)*
```
GET    /api/xiaozhi/status     # Get connection status
GET    /api/xiaozhi/config     # Get configuration (token masked)
PUT    /api/xiaozhi/config     # Update configuration
POST   /api/xiaozhi/restart    # Restart client connection
POST   /api/xiaozhi/start      # Start client
POST   /api/xiaozhi/stop       # Stop client
```
